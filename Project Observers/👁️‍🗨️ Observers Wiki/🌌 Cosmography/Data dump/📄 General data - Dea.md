### **Base Properties**

- **Type:** Natural satellite (native)
    
- **Mass:** ~0.3 × Earth’s Moon
    
    ≈ **2.20 × 10²² kg**
    
- **Mean orbital distance (semimajor axis):**
    
    **~260,000 km**
    
- **Orbit type:**
    
    Prograde, near-circular (slightly elliptical; low eccentricity)
    
- **Orbital period:**
    
    **~26 earth-days** (23.6 Z-days)
    
- **Orbital speed:**
    
    **~1.34 km/s**
    
- **Relative speed vs EXA:**
    
    ~**16.5% faster**
    
- **Composition:**
    
    ~Brittle, reflective
    
- **Color:**
    
    ~Pale yellow / ivory
    
- **Origin:**
    
    ~Native / accreted
    
- **Apparent size viewed from Zordurix:**
    
    ~0.00923 (compared to Exa’s 0.00938, about 1,5-2% difference)
    

### **Appearance**

- **Color:** Pale yellow / ivory
    
- **Brightness:** High (appears larger and brighter due to proximity)
    
- **Surface:** Chalky, dusty, brittle regolith
    
- **Sky presence:**
    
    Dominant in the night sky; visibly “runs” across the heavens faster than EXA
    

### **Composition & Structure**

- **Density:** Lower than EXA
- **Material:** Brittle, fragment-prone silicates; high dust production
- **Internal structure:** Likely fractured, rubble-heavy, weakly consolidated
- **Geological stability:** Poor — prone to cracking and shedding material under stress

### **Formation (Lore + Science!)**

- Formed **naturally** from the planet’s early accretion disk
- Considered the planet’s **“true child”**
- Its brittle nature makes it vulnerable to tidal stress and later magical interference

### **Cultural & Mythological Role**

- Seen as:
    - The **Living Moon**
    - The **Younger Sibling**
    - The **Runner**
- Associated with:
    - Growth, cycles, fertility, tides, daily rhythms
- Proto-civilizations used DEA’s ~10-day orbit as an early timekeeping unit
- During crescent phases, DEA’s illuminated edge appears **mirrored** compared to EXA
