### **Base Properties**


- **Origin:** debris from Xyrea formation (EXA–DEA collision)
    
- **Orbital distance:** ~310,000 km from Zordurix center
    
- **Width / Thickness:** ~30,000 km wide / ~150 km thick
    
- **Inclination:** 1–2° relative Zordurix’s equator
    
- **Composition:** ice/dust (DEA) + metallic fragments (EXA)
    
- **Albedo:** ~0.6
    
- **Visibility:**
    
    - **Daytime:** faint, mostly invisible except at low Sun angles
        
    - **Twilight:** highly reflective, appears like sparkling arcs across the sky (~5–6° vertical)
        
    - **Night:** faintly glowing, dual-color shimmer (blue-gray + yellow-orange)
    
    
- **Special:** seasonal shimmer due to tilt and partial shadowing        
    
- **Stability:** Expected to last hundreds to thousands of years before partial accretion or dispersion
