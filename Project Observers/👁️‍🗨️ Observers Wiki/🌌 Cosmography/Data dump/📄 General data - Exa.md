### **Base Properties**

- **Type:** Captured satellite (foreign)
    
- **Mass:** ~0.7 × Earth’s Moon
    
    ≈ **5.15 × 10²² kg**
    
- **Mean orbital distance (semimajor axis):**
    
    **~320,000 km**
    
- **Orbit type:**
    
    **Retrograde**, near-circular (slightly elliptical)
    
- **Orbital period:**
    
    **~39 Earth-days (35.5 Z-days)**
    
- **Orbital speed:**
    
    **~1.15 km/s**
    
- **Composition:**
    
    ~Dense, foreign
    
- **Color:**
    
    ~Cool blue-gray
    
- **Origin:**
    
    ~Captured
    
- **Apparent size viewed from Zordurix:**
    
    ~0.00938 (compared to Dea’s 0.00923, about 1,5-2% difference)
    

### **Appearance**

- **Color:** Blue / blue-gray
    
- **Brightness:** Lower than DEA; smaller apparent size
    
- **Surface:** Darker, denser rock (basaltic / metallic undertones)
    
- **Sky presence:**
    
    Moves _against_ the planet’s rotation — rises where DEA sets
    

### **Composition & Structure**

- **Density:** High (denser than DEA), foreign
- **Material:** Compact, resilient rock; possibly amalgam metallic core
- **Internal structure:** Stronger cohesion; survives impacts better
- **Geological stability:** High — resists fragmentation

### **Formation (Lore + Science Blend)**

- Captured long after planetary formation
- Originates from elsewhere in the system (or beyond)
- Retrograde orbit confirms foreign origin
- Viewed as an **outsider**, a watcher, or a judge

### **Cultural & Mythological Role**

- Seen as:
    - The **Elder Moon**
    - The **Backward Walker**
    - The **Silent Judge**
- Associated with:
    - Memory, death, fate, the deep ocean, dreams
- Its slow reverse motion unsettles early astronomers
- Crescent phases appear **opposite-facing** compared to DEA, reinforcing myths of opposition
