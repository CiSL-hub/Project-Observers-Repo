Also known as Cnidaree by locals, is a fort domain created by [[🪼 Elle the Everlasting]], concealed and floating above the endless tempest.

It has a unique ecosystem seen nowhere else, a remnant of the ‘old world’ preserved and maintained by her powers.

Locals refer to themselves as the Cnidarins

The island itself is essentially immobile, but alive nonetheless. It feeds off of everything that lives on top of it and makes food for itself by symbiotic photosynthesis

It can change the morphology of its body to suit the needs of Elle and its inhabitants

Something like deep sea gigantism occurs in a wide area with the effect stronger the more closer in-range to the Citadel
