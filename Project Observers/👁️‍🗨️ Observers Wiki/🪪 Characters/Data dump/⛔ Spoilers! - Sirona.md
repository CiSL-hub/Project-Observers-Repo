Sirona is a kawa-kitsune formerly known as [[🦊 Tomiko]]  which identity would later be rediscovered along on her travels. 

Tomiko would later transform into umi-kitsune then eventually tengoku-kitsune after enlightenment as her story progresses, ascending her into the [[💀 Primeval Gods]] status with clarity of her being, her origin, and her destiny.
