Poppie was born into a warm household of fisher and anglers.
When she was 8, it was revealed to her that her father, Silas abandoned the seafaring life to escape the barbaric ways of his own father and to find a path of life of his own, except, SIlas never told Poppie and she ended up understanding the truth when the debt is due.
[[🏴‍☠️ Cap'n Sighted]] had figured out where his son was hiding, and went seeking for his neck as the cost of betrayal and bringing shame to his name.

Poppie was hidden away by Marie, which ended up also being a casualty in the confrontation.

Eventually, a group of merchants crossing a nearby strait picked her up and her life was never the same since. None but her survived the incident, and a vengeful heart was born.
