Yukii is a lingering spirit of the only daughter of a late bourgeois family that got wiped during one winter. Roaming the alps with pain and obsession over unfairness keeping her bound and blind, manifesting as a restless banshee of sorts, haunting anyone who passes by until given closure one day, and decided to atone by living a new life with reason and discipline guiding her path.

---


Born physically frail, living in a family with high status. She was kept from the outside world and never really got the chance to go anywhere, or do much.

One day, she was promised by her parents that they’d go and see the world after they finished their work, but they never came home. Instead, some mountain wolves found their way to enter the manor one thick winter storm and the rest was history.

She never knew why her parents abandoned her. Out of rage and frustration, pain and confusion, she went berserk and lost her mind, terrorizing everyone she came across until one day, she got sealed by a shrine maiden known as [[🎭 Ayano The Husk]] for wreaking havoc one time around the forests leading up to her shrine. 

It is said that the seal can only be broken once she found the warmth she needed out there in her eternal winter.
