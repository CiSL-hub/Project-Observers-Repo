_(taught by scholars, temples, and state religion after the calamity)_

> 
> The soul is the vessel of being, and the spirit its bearing.
> 
> Yrium is neither soul nor spirit, but the substance from which both may arise.
> 
> The soul obeys fate, for it is formed within the laws of the world.
> 
> The spirit resists fate, for it is born of hope.
> 
> Hope does not defy nature, but it grants direction within it.
> 
> Thus, one with spirit walks a chosen path,
> 
> while one without spirit is carried like driftwood.
> 
> When a soul loses balance, it does not perish —
> 
> it returns to Yrium, and from Yrium new souls may one day form.
> 
> Therefore, to live well is to maintain harmony:
> 
> strong composition, guided spirit, restrained hope.
> 
> Excess of hope invites ruin.
> 
> Absence of hope invites stagnation.
> 
> Balance preserves the soul.
