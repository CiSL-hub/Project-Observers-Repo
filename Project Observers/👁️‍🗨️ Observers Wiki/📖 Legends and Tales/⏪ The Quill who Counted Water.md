Once, in the age when the dunes still bore names and men believed the earth listened, there lived one called [[Aseret]].

Aseret was no king, nor knight, nor keeper of sacred things. They bore no blade and spoke no prophecy. Their labor was quieter, and therefore heavier. Aseret counted water.

At dawn, before the sun had chosen its cruelty, they set marks in dust and later set them again upon paper—what came, what remained, what must be spared if sparing were permitted. Thus did they learn that numbers were truer than vows, and more dangerous in the wrong hands. For numbers do not lie, yet men wield them as they please.

The desert was harsh, but honest. It slew without ceremony and spared without favor. What Aseret feared were the cool rooms and shaded halls, where voices were soft and words like _balance_ and _efficiency_ were spoken, and where it was decided how long a life might be allowed to continue.

The people said that want was the law of the world. Aseret knew it to be arranged. Wells were sealed for a time and reopened elsewhere. Caravans turned aside at the stroke of a pen. Rations lessened not by halves but by whispers, so that no one might cry out too soon. Thus folk did not starve; they faded. Their backs bent, their voices thinned, and their names grew light enough to be misplaced.

Aseret wrote all of it down. Names and sums and losses, each set carefully in order, believing—ah, poor belief—that if the reckoning were plain enough, some hand would stay the course. Surely no soul wished such endings.

In one year of cruel calm, a border was redrawn. Not by sword, but by ink. A spring was given to one claim and taken from another, and this change was called temporary. Aseret saw the sum of it at once and felt cold beneath the sun. They sent word, set in proper language, that should the water not return ere the dry season passed, many would perish. The reply came clean and unsigned, praising diligence and reminding them that what is temporary rarely leaves scars.

The water did not return.

No trumpet marked the beginning of the loss. No fire fell. Only a season lingered too long. Coughs worsened. Doors stayed shut. Travelers departed and were not seen again. Children failed to grow into their years. Aseret continued to write, until one day they understood that no one awaited the tallies. The ledgers were no longer safeguards. They were gravestones.

Many would later ask why Aseret did not steal, or flee, or take up violence. The answer is plain and bitter: every path they saw demanded another’s ending. And Aseret had seen endings enough.

So they remained. They counted. They endured.

And endurance, unchallenged, hardened into doctrine.

The thought that seized them came not as frenzy, but as arithmetic. Justice, mercy, repair—these were words for systems that listened. Aseret reduced the world to its simplest measure: that which continues, and that which ends. Sleep thinned. Hunger dulled. Fear ceased to howl and instead whispered without pause.

The words that would not leave them were not fine, nor fit for song.

_This cannot be how it ends._

When the keeping of rations was bound into one hand and survival named a matter of efficiency, Aseret saw at last the truth of it: life was no longer spared by chance. It was granted by choice, and that choice had been made elsewhere.

One night, alone with ink and figures, Aseret set the sums again and again. Each path bent toward the same grave. Under the weight of mortal measure, survival failed in time.

They did not kneel. They did not curse the heavens. They did not beg.

They concluded.

If all things end under these bounds, then the bounds must be broken.

The desire did not cry out. It settled, heavy and absolute. And where the last embers of yrium yet slept beneath the skin of the world, something answered—not with kindness, but with obedience.

Aseret did not die, nor were they raised high. They were unmade as men are known to be made. Flesh took counsel only with one command: _do not end_. Thought ceased its wanderings. Memory loosened its grip. Pain found no crest, only continuance.

What went forth into the dunes thereafter was vast, and red, and unceasing.

A lass dyed in red named it **Cherrips**, for a fruit they knew, for it is the way of mortals to clothe terror in familiar names, that they may speak of it without choking.

And Cherrips walks still.

For once there was a person who counted water, and found that the world would not listen—so they became something that could not be made to stop.
