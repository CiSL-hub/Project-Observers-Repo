“But the **Eclipsed Core** was not divine, nor merciful. It was a gravastar, a hollowed star’s corpse, its shell spun of exotic matter, its belly an abyss that remembered all it consumed. It could not create, only **echo**. When a mortal pressed their wish upon it, the Core bent probability, folding reality to mirror the hunger inside them. Sacrifices were devoured—memory, vitality, love itself—until the wish appeared granted. Yet each gift was no gift, only a reflection, a twisted playback of desire.

It bent not to heaven’s crowns, but to dust-born hands alone, for they were fractured, incomplete, riddled with hungers the Core could seize and amplify. To touch it was to bind oneself to a mirror that never ceased reflecting.”

*”In its silence, only the voices of the finite were heard.”*
