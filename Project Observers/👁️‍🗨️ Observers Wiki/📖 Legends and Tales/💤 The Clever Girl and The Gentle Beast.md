On grassy plains where willows grew, A village slept the whole night through. They trusted walls of wood and straw, And never feared the Wolves they saw.

But Wolves are clever, Wolves are sly, They wait for dark, they wait for dry. They came one night with fire and sound, And left the grass all blackened ground.

A little girl ran fast and far, Past burning field, past fallen star. Into the woods where shadows play, Where even Wolves won’t choose to stay.

There on a path of roots and stone, She met a Beast, afraid, alone. With crooked limbs and borrowed shape, A thing most stories would escape.

The girl stood still, the Beast did too, One did not strike, the other knew. That fear can roar, or fear can shake, And shaking hearts are bound to break.

So hand in hand, away they fled, From smoking trees and glowing red. They ran until the water sang, And fire forgot the forest’s name.

By silver falls and mossy ground, They built a home no map had found. The girl taught words and how to stand, The Beast taught how to understand.

He learned of tools and gears and flame, Of human hopes and human names. She learned that strength is not just might, But staying kind in endless night.

When both had grown and time had turned, They left the woods with lessons learned. The world beyond was sharp and loud, And wary eyes looked not allowed.

The girl walked first on every road, She bore the weight, she bore the load. She fought the Wolves where others fled, She kept the weak from being dead.

The Beast walked quiet, stayed behind, A shadow gentle, slow, and kind. Though townsfolk cheered the girl so brave, They watched the Beast and would not wave.

Until one day the Wolves returned, With deeper scars and lessons learned. The ground shook hard, the sky grew thin, And courage had to choose again.

The village stood when dawn arrived, The Wolves were gone, the people thrived. A story spread from door to door, Of strength and beasts and something more.

But tales are strange and rarely fair, They keep what shines, lose what was there. The Beast remained, the roads stayed wide, The girl went on where songs reside.

Some say she walks the forest still, Where fire cannot bend her will. Some say she guards the farthest way, So Wolves won’t ever come to stay.

And some believe, when stars align, And waterfalls grow extra bright, A clever girl, with knowing eyes, Still walks the world where stories lie.
