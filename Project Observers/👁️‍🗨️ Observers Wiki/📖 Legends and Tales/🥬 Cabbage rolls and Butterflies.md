In the elder days, [[🍃 Ci the Origin]] sat with [[🎭 Ayano The Husk]], sharing tea among the gardens. The God spoke first, saying:

_"Why should I walk beside humankind? They are discord to me—shadows to my light, opposites who cannot share my path. You, born of my half, seem to walk among them with ease. How is this so?"_

The Husk was silent, then lifted her hand to where white butterflies drifted above the cabbages she had tended.

_"See how they feast upon the leaves we raise? They neither know me nor you, nor do we know them. To us they are pests, yet the garden is lovelier for their wings. Should we demand their understanding before we take joy in their presence?"_

She sipped her tea, then said:

_"Perhaps we shall never fathom their ways, just as they cannot fathom ours. Yet what matter is it? No one truly knows their own depths. To insist on understanding is to chase shadows. Better to walk slowly beside one another, to share the days as they come, and let memory be the bond we seek."_
