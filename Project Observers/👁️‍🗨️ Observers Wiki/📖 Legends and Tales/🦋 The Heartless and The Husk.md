Once, the Gods and mortals shared abode. The aforementioned Gods lives for a long - long time and holds supreme power capable of colossal change.

There was one God in particular, who stood out from the rest. He was cold and distant. He stood not alongside mortals. He was selfish and was unable to understand the mind of others. He was strong, but was so different from the rest. He was what people called [[🍃 Ci the Origin]], the God of creation

God of creation was not worshiped nor viewed highly however. He could not understand the mind of others and have given up in trying, thus everyone around him did the same for a long - long time.

However, suffering from loneliness and isolation, he created a figure, [[🎭 Ayano The Husk]] that should keep him company.

He gave the husk a name, and half of what he owns, including personality, life, the ability for making decisions, even half of his own power and told the husk to stay and guard the abode he was living in, thus making the husk bound to that place.

The husk would watch the world as it moves through time, it watches how a child would endlessly play, how mortals interact with one another on the shrine, learns how they put value on things or ideas. It observed everything around it, even the God that created it.

The God however, would shut himself in while the husk spends time outside, guarding and cleaning the abode. Overtime, the husk’s personality changes. It had absorbed much information that it affected its original thought process and planning capabilities. It had evolved and began to ask questions, it began to make decisions outside what it was supposed to, it began developing its own mind.

As time goes, The Husk influenced the God little by little. They would start to have arguments because of that, but The God enjoys its company nonetheless. The God tried his best every day to understand the husk, and he would eventually finally come to understand the way of mortals respectively. He understood them so much that he started to care for them.

At this point, _The God was no longer Heartless, and the Husk was no longer a mere empty shell._ They became truly one and inseparable. A better being together than each of them separated alone.

However… The good times came and went, their duration short-lived.

The [Calamity](https://www.notion.so/The-Calamity-9061749879fa48d0916eb011fa9aecca?pvs=21) happened, and everyone was in turmoil. Some of the Gods sheltered the mortals, some Gods were weak and was hopeless when it happened. Some of the Gods fled to another dwelling. The God of creation however, stays to protect the mortals.

The God of creation, who has collosal amount of power, was unfortunately not strong enough to negate the event. He could not destroy, nor create anything to prevent it from happening. The Husk knew of this but sticks with the God to help him out. She believed that together, they might be able to pull something off.

The God could not recreate all living beings as his life force wouldn’t even be nearly enough to do so. Even if he somehow manages that, the new world wouldn’t be habitable for them.

He knew that if push comes to shove, the Husk would happily sacrifice herself for him and the greater good. But the husk grew to be more than a tool for his convenience. So he devised a plan, and the Husk trusted him with no shred of doubt.

Through self-guided selfish resolution, he alone sacrificed every bit of his being to create a barrier, stretching from one horizon to the other. It was to be a bulwark against the relentless tide of destruction that had ravaged the land for tad too long, a bastion of hope amidst a sea of despair, that would eventually shatter after exhaustion which then grant the ecosystem the rejuvenation necessary for new life to thrive.

At his last moments, He said to the husk that he will miss her, their time together, and the warmth of home. _“Keep the place nice and clean will you?”_ said The God to the Husk. The Husk did not understand what the God meant, but soon realized after seeing him disintegrate into the air, leaving nothing but his broken mask, and a broken husk.

In an instant, a tree sprouted and grew into towering heights. The ash-black sky splits in half, revealing a beam of light shining down a path to a newly spawned tree. The residual power from the shattered barrier bursts through the sky, reaching every corner of the world while summoning a gentle rain and mist. A turquoise colored solution spews out of the tree resembling a waterfall, flowing down its branches. And as the light of the new day dawned, the first signs of growth appeared around the tree, a testament to his sacrifice and his unwavering determination.

It was a happy ending to everyone except the husk. The husk collapses to the ground and wept silently beside the tree as everyone rejoiced. As she mourns, a gentle calm voice could be heard everywhere that says:  _“May my body disintegrate, enriching the lands, the skies and seas, and my soul be forever rooted into all that lives”._

The Husk was named Satou Ayano, and The God was called Ci.
