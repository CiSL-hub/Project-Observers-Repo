Once upon a time, in the place where dunes pretended to be land and land pretended to be stable, there lived a person named **Aseret**.

Aseret did not fight monsters or speak to gods. They did not dream of conquest, prophecy, or glory. They counted water.

Every morning, before the heat finished deciding what the day would take, Aseret wrote numbers in the dust and then copied them carefully onto paper—how much water arrived, how much remained, how much could be spared without anyone noticing too soon. They learned early that numbers were safer than promises. Numbers did not lie, though people often used them to.

The dunes were harsh, but they were honest. If the sun killed you, it did so openly. What Aseret feared were the shaded rooms where men spoke softly about efficiency and balance, and decided how long survival was allowed to last.

People said scarcity was natural. Aseret knew it was managed. They saw wells marked _temporarily unavailable_. They watched caravans redirected for reasons that sounded reasonable until written down. They noticed how rations shrank not in halves or quarters, but in margins so small no one complained at first. People did not starve suddenly. They thinned. They tired. They learned to be quiet.

Aseret wrote everything down. Names, dates, adjustments, losses. They believed—truly believed—that if the numbers were clear enough, someone would intervene. Surely no one wanted people to die.

One season, a boundary was adjusted. Not with soldiers, but with ink. A water source was reassigned from one settlement to another, officially and temporarily. Aseret saw the projection immediately and felt cold despite the heat. They submitted a report explaining, in careful language, that if the change remained through the dry season, loss of life was statistically certain. The reply came back neat and unsigned, thanking them for their diligence and reminding them that temporary measures rarely produced permanent harm.

The water was rerouted. It never returned.

There was no disaster. No single moment people later pointed to and said _this is when it began_. There was only a season where illness lingered too long, where people left to find better work and did not come back, where fewer children reached adulthood than the numbers predicted. Aseret kept writing. At some point, without ceremony, no one requested the reports anymore.

That was when something in Aseret shifted. Their work had stopped being prevention. It had become documentation.

Many would later ask why Aseret did not steal, or flee, or fight. The answer is simple and unsatisfying: every solution they imagined required someone else to end first. Aseret had already watched enough endings. So they stayed. They counted. They endured. Slowly, endurance became the only thing that mattered.

The thought that took root did not arrive like madness. It arrived like math. Aseret stopped thinking about fairness or justice or reform. Those ideas required systems that listened. They reduced the world to two states—continues, and ends. Sleep became shallow. Hunger became background noise. Fear settled into a constant hum that never rose high enough to break.

The sentence that repeated in their mind was not poetic. It was dull, heavy, impossible to argue with.

_This cannot be how it ends._

When ration control was centralized and survival made efficient, Aseret understood something with perfect clarity: survival was no longer accidental. It was optional. And someone was choosing who did not receive it.

One night, alone with their ledgers, Aseret ran the calculations again. And again. Every path led to the same conclusion. Under human limits, survival always failed eventually.

They did not pray. They did not curse the gods. They did not ask for justice or revenge. They reached a solution.

If ending was inevitable under these conditions, then the conditions had to be removed.

The desire did not flare or shout. It settled. It became absolute. And somewhere, where the last remnants of yrium still lingered like embers buried too deep to see, the world responded—not with mercy, but with obedience.

Aseret did not die. They did not ascend. They stopped being a person in the way the world recognizes people. Flesh rearranged itself around a single instruction: do not end. Thoughts ceased to finish. Memory lost relevance. Pain no longer escalated; it merely existed.

What crawled into the dunes afterward was vast and red and enduring.

[[Yzzabea]] would later name it **Cherrips**, after a fruit they knew, because mortals always name horrors after familiar things to make them easier to speak about.

And Cherrips still walks.

Because once upon a time, someone counted water—and decided that ending was unacceptable.
