### Short Parable

It is told that the God of Creation once asked the Husk:

*"Why do men walk with you, when they cannot with me?"*

The Husk answered with the flight of butterflies:

*"They do not know us, nor we them, yet the garden is brighter for their wings."*

And she said:

*"To seek understanding is vanity, for none know even themselves. Better to walk slowly together, and let memory be the bond."*

### Oral Myth

In a quiet hour, the God of Creation and the Husk shared tea beneath the shade of the garden.

The God spoke: *“Man is unlike us. They are discordant, a world apart. I cannot reach them.”*

The Husk answered not with dispute, but with gesture—pointing to the white wings drifting among the cabbages.

*“See how these butterflies trouble us both: they spoil your beloved rolls and gnaw the crops I tend. They do not understand us, nor we them. Yet the garden would be poorer without their flight.”*

The God frowned: *“Then what use is it to seek understanding?”*

The Husk smiled: *“None at all. Even man knows not his own heart. To demand comprehension is vanity. What endures are not answers, but steps shared, days remembered, the beauty left in passing.”*
