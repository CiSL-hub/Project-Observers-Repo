There was once a maiden whose longing knew no bounds. Her body was frail, her steps unsteady, yet her desire burned brighter than any flame. She sought a form unbroken, a vessel that no chain, no hunger, no time could mar.

From her yearning she wove a body anew—radiant as moonlit waters, crowned in living light, a creature both fragile and eternal. It required no soil, no sustenance, no companion to endure. Wounds closed as they were made, age slipped from it like a shadow undone. To her it was perfection, a body without end.

She whispered in joy, _“Now at last I am free.”_

But freedom was not given, only drift. Her new flesh bore no strength, her steps no anchor. It was a body that endured, yet could not rest; a vessel that gleamed, yet could not change. Her prison was no longer bone nor chain, but glass—clear, cold, unyielding.

Thus the maiden who sought all things was denied them still. She became a phantom of eternity, radiant but hollow, immortal yet incomplete—an unending yearning, clothed in light.
