"In the dawn of days, there lived a maiden whose heart was shaped for love. Yet her pleas went unanswered, and her arms closed upon emptiness.

Grief made her hunger. Desire swelled within until it broke its bounds, and she longed not only for love but for the treasures of the earth and the marvels of the heavens. Yet she was mortal, and her years too brief to drink of all she sought.

So she cast her prayer into the void, crying for eternity. The heavens listened—and gave. The stars wheeled on, and she endured. The rivers ran dry, and she endured. Empires withers, and still she endured.

But the gift was hollow. For eternity without love is but a chord with no strings. Her longing, never answered, turned to a song of sorrow that could unmake the hearts of those who heard it. She was called many names—Wraith, Wane of Delight, Breaker of Mirth. Yet once she was only a girl, who asked for love and found only silence.

And so she wandered, eternal yet incomplete, a tale told not in love, nor joy, but in aching silence: a prayer unanswered, a cry beneath endless skies, a lament to the world.

In the brink of madness, she took it upon herself to seize what the heavens denied. In an act of desperation, she poured out what remained of her boundless being, and shaped a fragment of the world into her own reflection. Small and twisted though it was, it bore her mark—a stage of solitude, a mockery of what she once desired. A discord in the chord, a fragile delusion, born of her own sorrow.

Thus was wrought a discord in the void, a frail delusion against eternity itself. A citadel of what’s left of her humanity, a palace of tragedy."
