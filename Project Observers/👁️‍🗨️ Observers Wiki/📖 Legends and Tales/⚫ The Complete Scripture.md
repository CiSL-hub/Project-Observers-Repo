"In the age when stars still wept, a hollow sun was born from heaven’s collapse. From its heart fell the **Eclipsed Core**, jewel of endless night, keeper of desire eternal. It was said that the Core did not destroy but remembered. Into its depths all things could be poured—sorrows, prayers, longings—and from it the world would bend, reshaped to answer the yearning of the heart. Kings sought it to build empires, priests sought it to speak with gods, and lovers whispered to it for forevermore. For to hold the Core was to command fate itself, the chalice of infinity."

“A wish cast into the hollow star returns as destiny.”

“But the **Eclipsed Core** was not divine, nor merciful. It was a gravastar, a hollowed star’s corpse, its shell spun of exotic matter, its belly an abyss that remembered all it consumed. It could not create, only **echo**. When a mortal pressed their wish upon it, the Core bent probability, folding reality to mirror the hunger inside them. Sacrifices were devoured—memory, vitality, love itself—until the wish appeared granted. Yet each gift was no gift, only a reflection, a twisted playback of desire.

It bent not to heaven’s crowns, but to dust-born hands alone, for they were fractured, incomplete, riddled with hungers the Core could seize and amplify. To touch it was to bind oneself to a mirror that never ceased reflecting.”

”In its silence, only the voices of the finite were heard.”

“No wish is given freely. The Core drinks deeper than oceans, taking not what is offered, but what is needed. It swallows years like sand, turns laughter into silence, and steals names until none remember them. All who dare its gift must pay, though they know not what is owed. And yet, the granted desire is no true boon. For what is returned is but an echo, a hollow shadow of the heart’s cry. Empires rose, but their stones crumbled to dust. Lovers clasped hands, but forgot the faces they once adored. What the Core bestows, also unravels, beyond remains of ashes where longing once burned.”

“The Eclipsed Core bestows only the transient, and claims the unreturning.”
