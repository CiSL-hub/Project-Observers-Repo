The border between the Old and New world

---

It happened long ago ( Centuries before the main story timeline ) when the two moons [[🌑 Exa]] and [[🌕 Dea]] collided, shattering both moons into creating a new smaller moons, and a ring system around [[🌐 Zordurix]]

The collision caused massive destruction and chaos on the planet, leading to the extinction of many species and the rise of new ones. The event also created a magical disturbance that still affects the world to this day, causing unpredictable anomalies and dangerous phenomena that make exploration and travel hazardous in certain areas.

The Calamity is still remembered as one of the most catastrophic events in the history of Zordurix. Its aftermath has left a lasting impact on the planet, with many regions still struggling to recover. However, the event also paved the way for new beginnings and opportunities, with the rise of new species and magic.

The Event birthed the first raw form of what’s now known as [[❇️ Yrium]]

Despite the dangers and challenges that came with the Calamity, many still venture out into the unknown, seeking to uncover the mysteries of Zordurix. Some seek to harness the power of the magical anomalies for their own gain, while others simply seek knowledge and understanding.

The legacy of the Calamity continues to shape the [[🌺 New World]] of Zordurix and all who inhabit it.
