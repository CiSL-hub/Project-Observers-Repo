In many lands, soul and spirit are spoken as one, their names traded as if they were the same breath.

But in Zordurix, such confusion is considered a grave simplification.

The soul is the greater form — the vessel of being.

Yet even the soul is not the beginning.

Beneath it flows the Yrium, the unseen current from which all souls are shaped.

Yrium is not a soul, just as blood is not a body, nor wind a storm.

It is the substance that _permits_ a soul to exist, given proper form, balance, and restraint.

Thus, a soul is an organism, and Yrium its organs — many, delicate, and bound by structure.

When that structure falters, when the composition turns unstable, the soul does not die —

it **ceases to be a soul**.

Of all things, the soul stands closer to the spirit than to Yrium, despite Yrium being its foundation.

For Yrium gives shape, but spirit gives direction.

What gives rise to spirit is hope.

Where hope burns, spirit walks upright.

Where hope is absent, spirit dissolves — wandering without aim, dragged by fate,

bound only to the laws of the world that refuses to release it.

Such a being is a soul without spirit:

intact, enduring, yet hollow.

When the spirit is raised — when hope overcomes weight and fear —

the people of Zordurix say one does not merely exist.

They say one has begun to live.
