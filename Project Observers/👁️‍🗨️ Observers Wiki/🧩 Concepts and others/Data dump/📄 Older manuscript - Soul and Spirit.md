It is mostly a universal understanding that the concept of soul and spirit are usually interchangeable, but such are not the case in Zordurix.

The soul refers to the greater essence of Zordurix. While the essence itself is called the Yrium, Yrium is in conclusion, not a soul.

A soul is akin to an organism, whereas Yrium the organs, the fundamental principle that makes up a soul given the right composition and structure.

When the composition is unstable, a soul could cease a soul.

It is also true that ‘soul’ is more closely related to the ‘spirit’ than Yrium, it’s basic components.

What makes a spirit, is hope.

A spirit without one is lost, wandering endlessly without purpose, a soul, bound to fate and the laws of nature in which they reside.

When the spirit is in a ‘high spirited state’, it is said that one truly begins ‘living life’.
