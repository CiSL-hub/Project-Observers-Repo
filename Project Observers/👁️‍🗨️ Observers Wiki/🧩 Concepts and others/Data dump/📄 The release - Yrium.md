During the Calamity, the God of Creation used the last of his power to protect the world from destruction. Unfortunately, he was not strong enough to fully accomplish this task. 

In a final act of mercy for the world, the God sacrificed his remaining life force to create a shield that would block the incoming shower of moon debris. 

When the God finally perished, his remaining power scattered across [[🌐 Zordurix]], laying the foundation for new life to begin.

The scattered remnants of the God's power eventually coalesced into a new mineral called Yrium. This element had the ability to enhance the natural abilities of living creatures, leading to the birth of many new species with unique powers. 

Over time, Zordurians discovered the many uses of [[❇️ Yrium]], including its ability to power machines and It also possesses unique properties that allow it to store and channel magical energy.
