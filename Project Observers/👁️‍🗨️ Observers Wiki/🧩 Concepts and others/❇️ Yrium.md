### Origin

It first appeared upon the creation of the world and became spiritually tangible after [[🌓 The Calamity]] ended, in a pure gas and liquid form - gently raining down on zordurix from the craters to the rest of the world.


### Trivia

“May the body degrade, and soul returns to the flow of Yrium”, is often said when someone dies. In reality, this is not true and just a misconception that people believe to be true.
