# Welcome! 🌸

To the public showcase of my personal IP Project Observers!

## What am I looking at?

This page is just the welcoming screen to the vault itself. You can choose where to go next from here by clicking on the list on the top left

## The purpose

There are a lot of reasons for this showcase, some of them are:

### 1. Getting it out there

Like any art, it will have a hard time serving the broader purpose of bridging ideas / information to others if kept to oneself.

### 2. A medium of accountabiity

I am human just like any others, and I do procrastinate too. This shall be a constant reminder to me to keep updating the wiki and working on it because others can see it too.

## Footnote

This IP is a lifetime of work and a legacy to me. Whatever I left here shall be one of my best works throughout my life.
I hope it is entertaining to explore.

Happy Reading! 🚀
